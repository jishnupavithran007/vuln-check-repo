# Autonomous setup — how this runs without a human orchestrator

Two GitHub Actions do everything. Once set up, nobody drives it.

**Ranking is automatic:** Renovate applies the tier labels at PR creation (see
`packageRules` in `/renovate.json`). No separate scoring step runs in CI — the
label *is* the rank. (`score-risk-tier.mjs` is only for local dry-runs.)

## How it triggers

- **Periodic:** `renovate.yml` runs on a weekly cron.
- **Manual:** GitHub → **Actions → renovate → Run workflow** (workflow_dispatch).
- **Per PR:** `verify-and-heal.yml` fires automatically on every
  `chore/upgrade-*` pull request (opened / updated).

## Recommended setup (least moving parts)

### 1. Stage 1 — pick ONE way to create PRs
- **Best: install the Mend Renovate GitHub App** →
  https://github.com/apps/renovate → enable it on this repo. It runs on a
  schedule, reads `renovate.json`, opens tiered PRs, and gives Merge Confidence
  badges. **No token to manage.** If you do this, you can delete `renovate.yml`.
- **Or self-host** `renovate.yml`: add secret `RENOVATE_TOKEN` = a GitHub PAT
  with `repo` scope (fine-grained: Contents R/W, Pull requests R/W, Issues R/W).

### 2. Stage 3 — the Claude credential (add ONE as a repo secret)
The workflow accepts either. Add it under
**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**.

- **Subscription (Claude Team/Pro/Max — no API billing):** run
  `claude setup-token` in your terminal, authorize in the browser, copy the
  `sk-ant-oat...` token. Secret name: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.
  (Check your org allows using the subscription in automation.)
- **API key (needs an Anthropic Console org with billing):** console.anthropic.com
  → API Keys → create. Secret name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Note: a Claude Team *membership* is not the same as API access — the API
Console is separate billing. If you can't create a key there, use the
subscription token above or ask your Anthropic account admin.

### 3. Stage 5 — let tier-3 auto-merge
- Repo → **Settings → General → Pull Requests → ✅ Allow auto-merge**
- (Optional) **Settings → Branches → add a rule for `main`** requiring the
  `verify-and-heal` status check, so nothing merges until verification is green.

## That's it

With the Mend app + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the whole pipeline is autonomous:
- **weekly** (or on demand) Renovate opens tiered PRs,
- each PR self-verifies,
- breaking ones get healed by Claude,
- shortcuts get caught by guardrails and routed to a human,
- clean tier-3 patches auto-merge.

No local scripts, no orchestrator. The local scripts in this folder are the
same logic, runnable by hand for debugging.
